# Project Title

This is the documentation for the Jala university fullstack bootcamp Brazil 01 training project.

This documentation will discribe the process that we will follow for this project.

Here you will find the stages in which the project is divided as well as the definitions established by the team for each stage.

### Methodology

 - Scrumban (Scrum + Kanban)

Scrum is an agile management framework that employs an iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. It combines four formal events within a sprint with a primary focus on transparent planning, inspection of objectives and adaptation of results.

On the other hand Kanban is not a methodology nor a process framework.
Rather, it is a management method or approach that should be
applied to an existing process or way of working. There is never
a question of using Kanban versus a given methodology or
framework. Rather, it is always adding Kanban using an existing
methodology, framework, or way of working. Kanban is intended
to help you manage work better and to improve service
delivery to the point where you consistently meet customer
expectations. Kanban is a means to improve what and how you
already do things. It is not a replacement for what you already
do.

Both are empirical methods that derive partially from lean thinking and continuous improvement and may focus on the process or the product.

Scrumban evolves from Scrum with the addition of Kanban Practices such as Visualization, Limits for Work in Progress, and Workflow Management.

Scrumban combines the best features of Scrum and Kanban methods. It brings together the normative nature of Scrum and the process improvement capability of Kanban, allowing teams to move towards Agile development to constantly improve their processes.

### Scrum Team

- Scrum Master - Rotation between the team
- Product Owner - Estiven Salinas
- Developers -

### Scrum Events

- Two weeks sprints
- Sprint start mondays - planning
- Daylies during sprint time - 5 min max for each
- One day before nobody can push to repository
- Sprint closing fridays - Demo/Review and Retro

### Definition of Ready

- The task's name is clear so the team can understand the story at first sight.
- The task is described from the user's point of view, in the following format:
  _"As a [**actor**] I want [**action**] so that [**achievement**]"_
- Acceptance criteria list about what the task needs to achieve.
- Task size has been estimaded (Fibonacci)
- Task is independent (it does not depend on the conclusion of another task)
- All Scrum team members has a clearly understanding of the user stories

### Definition of Done

- Automated tests are passing
- CI/CD build is passing
- Code reviewed
- Documentation related to the task are updated
- Acceptance criteria items are met

#### Conclusion
The work is ready when the requirements are clear and the team has the capability to give an estimation time and garantee that the work can be delived accordingly to the user stories, and is done once everything is completed and we can ship to production. In addition, the criteria on what it means to have the work ready or done can vary from each Product Owner or Sprint.
